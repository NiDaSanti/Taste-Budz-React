This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Taste-Budz-React
COLLABORATORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO DROP IN IDEAS BELOW ON WHAT THE USER CAN DO. LET'S ALL TRY TO REMAIN CONSISTANT WITH THE GOAL AT HAND WHICH IS......? IDK RIGHT NOW, IM WORKING ON THAT. HAHAHA!! <-------- IGNORE THAT LAUGH!
MISSION STATEMENT COMING SOON.....


Taste Budz mission is to allow the user to share their favorite dish to a community of other people.
Users will have the ability to input a recipe of their choosing through their personal accounts.
Users will have the option to share their recipes with other users.  to be continued ....




#Log notes:
The firebase is done as far as creating accounts.  With that being said, there is nothing else you can do after that at this time.  
So far a random recipe renders in the GuestDashboard class Component. In human terms.... you can see a recipe on the screen with written
instructions with an image of the meal. Lot's of them are yummy and I've never heard of or seem so much deliciousness. Ok, that's corny, but
back to the current feature in the random recipe. Under the image, they're two icons, a fork with a knife, and "i" icon for information.
The fork and knife icon renders another component called "ExtendedIngredients". Inside that component users can see the ingredients needed to create
their meal. The "i" icon doesn't do anything at this time, however it will be changing in due time. The icons are animated and the images are clickable.
Of course improvements are a must, but in due time....... nothing else to report at this time.

#Log notes:
After looking at the instructions. I found step by step instructions. Instead of having a long paragraph it can be written in a form of step by step instructions... so currently it's being changed...... nothing else to report at this time...
